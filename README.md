DOMESTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT

Improper waste disposal not only contributes to environmental pollution but also affects the overall cleanliness and hygiene of a neighborhood. The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that address the specific issue of neighbors disposing of waste bags irresponsibly, causing litter and unsightly conditions. Participants are encouraged to propose and implement ideas that tackle this challenge and promote responsible waste management practices within the community. The solutions should focus on: Awareness and Education: Develop educational campaigns or initiatives to raise awareness among neighbors about the importance of proper waste disposal.
